CSS works by defining a set of rules that determine the appearance of elements on a web page. These rules are made up of CSS selectors, which select the HTML elements to be styled, and declarations, which define the styles to be applied to the selected elements.

CSS selectors can be based on elements, classes, IDs, and attributes, and they allow you to target specific HTML elements on a page. For example, you can use a class selector to apply styles to all elements with a specific class attribute, or an ID selector to apply styles to a specific element with a unique ID attribute.

Declarations specify the styles to be applied to the selected elements. They consist of a property and a value, and are separated by a colon. For example, the declaration "color: blue" sets the color property of an element to blue.

CSS rules are applied to HTML elements in the order that they are defined in the stylesheet. If multiple rules apply to the same element, the "cascading" nature of CSS takes effect, and the rules are combined in a specific way to determine the final appearance of the element.

CSS can be included in an HTML document using a <style> tag, or it can be stored in an external stylesheet and linked to the HTML document using a <link> tag.

CSS is an essential part of modern web development, as it allows for easy control and customization of the appearance of web pages, making it easier to create visually appealing and accessible websites.



The CSS background property is used to define the background of an HTML element.

The CSS attribute defines the background effect:

background-color
background-image
background-repeat
background-attachment
background-position
  
The color property is used to set the color of the text.

Colors are most often specified via CSS as follows.

A hexadecimal value - e.g.: #FF0000
An RGB value - e.g.: RGB(255,0,0)
The name of the color - e.g.: red
  
  CSS Fonts
In CSS, there are two types of font family names.

General font family - a combination of font systems that have a similar appearance (e.g. "Serif" or "Monospace")
Specific font family - a specific font family (e.g. "Times" or "Courier")
  Link Styles
Links can be styled with any CSS property (e.g. color, font, background, etc.).

Special links, can be styled differently, depending on what state they are in.

The four link states are

a:link - normal, unvisited link
a:visited - the link has been visited by the user
a:hover - when the user mouses over the link
a:active - the moment the link is clicked
  The CSS list property works as follows.

Set different list items to be marked as ordered lists
Set different list items to be marked as unordered lists
Set the list items to be marked as images
