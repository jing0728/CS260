HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language and is a language used to create web pages and other types of digital content. It provides a structure for content on the web and allows you to create pages with headings, paragraphs, images, links, and other elements. HTML is used in conjunction with other technologies, such as CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) for styling and JavaScript for dynamic interactivity, to create dynamic and interactive websites.

HTML pages can be connected through hyperlinks. Hyperlinks are created using the "a" (anchor) tag in HTML and allow you to create links between different pages or sections within a single page. To create a hyperlink, you would specify the destination URL or the location of the target page using the "href" attribute. For example, here is how you could create a hyperlink to Google's homepage in HTML
When this link is clicked, the user will be taken to the Google homepage. This is just one example of how HTML hyperlinks can be used to connect multiple pages and create a network of related content on the web.

HTML structural elements are used to define the different parts of an HTML document and provide a clear structure for the content. Some common HTML structural elements include:

<html>: This element is the root element of an HTML document and contains all other elements.

<head>: The head element contains information about the document, such as the title of the page, which is displayed in the browser's tab, and meta information, such as keywords and description.

<body>: The body element contains the main content of the document, such as text, images, and other elements.

<header>: The header element is used to define a header section for the document, which typically contains the logo, navigation, and other introductory content.

<nav>: The nav element is used to define a section of the document that contains navigation links.

<main>: The main element is used to define the main content of the document, which is unique to the document and distinguishes it from other content, such as navigation or headers.

<section>: The section element is used to define a section of the document, such as a chapter or a group of related content.

<article>: The article element is used to define a self-contained piece of content, such as a blog post or a news article.

<aside>: The aside element is used to define a section of the document that contains content that is tangentially related to the main content, such as a sidebar or a pull quote.

<footer>: The footer element is used to define a footer section for the document, which typically contains information such as the author, copyright information, and links to related content.

These HTML structural elements provide a consistent way to organize content and make it easier for web browsers to display the content correctly and for search engines to understand the structure of the page.

The <header> element is an HTML tag used to define a header section for a web page. The header typically contains introductory information such as the logo, navigation links, and other content that is common across multiple pages of a website.The header can be used anywhere within the <body> element and can be used multiple times on a single page.

A DOCTYPE (Document Type Declaration) is a required component of an HTML document and is used to declare the type of document being used, such as HTML5, XHTML, or HTML 4.01. The DOCTYPE declaration should be the first line of an HTML document and should be included in every HTML page.
