			<h2>Morphological characteristics</h2>
			<p>The body of the cat is divided into five parts: head, neck, torso, limbs and tail, most parts are covered with hair, a few are hairless cats.</p>
			<p>Cats have fatty fleshy pads on the bottom of their toes, so they walk silently and do not scare away mice when they catch them, and have sharp nails on the ends of their toes. The claws can be retracted and extended. The cat's claws retract when resting and walking, and only extend when trapping and climbing to prevent the nails from being blunted. </p>
			<p>Cats have five fingers on the front limbs and four fingers on the hind limbs. The cat's teeth are divided into incisors, canines, and molars. The canine teeth are particularly well developed and sharp as cones, suitable for biting rodents caught, and the molars have sharp protrusions on their chewing surfaces, suitable for chewing meat to pieces; the incisors are not well developed. </p>
			<p>If a beam of light is directed into a cat's eyes, these reflections are yellow-green in color, and in blue-eyed cats they are red, so we see the cat's eyes glowing at night. This irradiated reflection is used by cats as a way to improve their ability to see in the morning and at dusk, due to a luminous film behind their retina. After light passes through the retina with its visual cells, it is reflected back off this illuminated film and passes through the light-sensitive area again. </p>
			<p>Cats are able to walk and jump lightly on high walls without any problems. This is largely due to the cat's exceptional reactive nerves and sense of balance. It can balance itself with a slight change in the position and height of its tail, and then use the strong muscles and strong joints of its hind feet to jump agilely and change its position in the air to land lightly and accurately, even when falling from a height. Good at climbing high, but not good at falling from the top. Even when falling or jumping from a height, the cat relies on its tail to adjust its balance and land on its padded limbs. </p>
