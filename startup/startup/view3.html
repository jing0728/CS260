			<p>The civet cat originated in China and is a natural cat, a breed that has survived the natural elimination of many breeds over the centuries. The most familiar is the story of the "civet cat changing the prince" (Song Dynasty), which is the earliest record of the civet cat that can be found, so the civet cat has the English name DragonLi, awarded by the CFA Cat Association. It is very popular with the people because it has a beautiful, thick fur and a healthy body. It is easy to feed and is very good at catching mice. </p>
			<p>The civet cat was presented at the cat show on the 4th floor of Beijing New Dong'an Market from January 1 to 3, 2003, and the Chinese civet cat judging standard compiled and written by the CFA China Great Wall Cat Club in 2004 was recognized by the CFA, the authoritative organization in the international cat world, as the first purebred cat breed standard developed by China itself. </p>
			<p>The civet cat has a very independent personality, is athletic and cheerful, and will be very sensitive if there is a change in the surrounding environment. It is very dependent on its owner, and if it is suddenly given a new owner, it may become psychologically depressed. Although the adult cat will not be very fond of playing with people, it will still walk around in your sight at all times. It is a very subtle animal and is confident in itself and loyal to its owner. </p>
			<p>Appearance: The civet cat has a very round head, two ears that exist not too far apart, ears that are very appropriately sized, a very broad root, a very deep auricle, and a relatively rounded part that sits at the tip.

The nose is brick red in color with a black "stroke". The civet has a very modest build, with a broad chest, but also a deep, thick chest. The limbs, like the tail, are of moderate length, very well suited, very muscular, and very strong. The impression left is that there is a very robust body, and a large round face that is comparable to a short English. It was very cute when it was small. </p> 
			<p>Coat and coat color: The coat of the civet cat is made up of long guard hairs and short fluffy hairs that are short, stiff, shiny, and very smooth. The civet cat has very clear and distinctive markings. The association only recognizes the mackerel spots, preferably the "BrokenMackerel Tabby", which is usually called the civet pattern, because this pattern is very similar to the wild leopard cat (civet); on its forehead, it has the M-shaped pattern common to all tiger cats, and in the corner of the eyes, there are The extended "eye line" is located at the corner of the eye. The ringed necklace is found on the neck, limbs and tail; the fish bone spine pattern (complete mackerel spots) or "spots" (broken mackerel spots) are found on the body. </p>
				
			<p>Feeding focus: In the home, the feeding problem for the civet cat is very simple, it does not need much attention, as long as there is very clean water and suitable rations for it, which is necessary for it to live a happy life. The cats have evolved over thousands of years and ordinary minor ailments will not trap them as they have a very high ability to adjust themselves and are not afraid of cold weather. </p>
