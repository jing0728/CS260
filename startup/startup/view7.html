			<h2>Domestication method</h2>
			<img src="images/view7.jpg"/>
			<p>When training a cat, do not be too hasty to hit the cat, in fact, this is very easy to be attacked by the cat. When cats are attacked, they will instinctively send out a counterattack, so there are situations where the owner is scratched or bitten. </p>
			<p>Cats must be given an immediate education at the scene of the mistake. This may not be easy to do, as most cat owners must be away at work all day, leaving the cat alone in the house to run amok. </p>
			<p>It is important that the owner's specific standards are consistent each time the cat is taught, as this is the only way to make the cat realise exactly what it has done wrong. The only way to make your cat aware of what it is doing wrong is to have one standard today and another tomorrow. </p> 
			<p>Cats are generally arrogant and have a strong sense of self-esteem. You can educate them, but don't hit them when you get angry, as they will feel insulted and resent their owners for it. </p>
			<p>Have a water-filled gun or a vocaliser handy when training. Whenever the cat climbs on a chair or grinds its teeth on the furniture, fire the squirt gun at it or shake the vocalizer next to it. If you can't keep an eye on him, keep him in a room where he can't engage in bad behaviour. Never use physical punishment and never hit him on the head or bottom. Physical punishment will only make the cat afraid of its owner. </p>
			<p>Many people are annoyed that cats like to jump around, but when they go where cats are not allowed to go. This is when we have to establish our territory and when the cat comes again, we have to stop it by pinching the hair on its neck and gently pressing it to the ground. The cat will be able to reinforce the memory by saying "no" or "no" forcefully and repeatedly. </p>
			<p>Praise makes for good relationships, and in fact people and animals are no exception. So when your cat does something you're happy with, you should gently stroke its head and say a few words of praise to it. This will help to make life more harmonious. </p>
			<p>We also need to play games with our cats often, which can make them feel better at home every day and make them less lonely. And it can also develop the relationship between the pet owners. People say that pets' feelings are created in the game. </p>
			<p>If your cat is suddenly very emaciated, it's probably because you don't care enough about it. People and cats are the same, they are also afraid of being alone. So we need to give our cats a healthy mindset and this is the time when we learn to cuddle them often and develop a deeper bond with them. </p></div>
