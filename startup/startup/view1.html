			<h2>Origin of cat breed</h2>
			<img src="images/view1.jpg"/>
			<p>Cats, belonging to the feline family, are divided into domestic and feral cats, and are more widely used as pets in households around the world. The ancestors of the domestic cat are presumed to be the desert cats of ancient Egypt and the Persian cats of Persia, which have been domesticated by humans for 3,500 years (but not as fully domesticated as dogs).</p>
			<p>General cat: round head, short face, five fingers on the forelimbs, four toes on the hindlimbs, sharp and curved claws at the end of the toes, claws retractable. Nocturnal. Hunts other animals by ambush, and can mostly climb up trees. Cats have fatty fleshy pads on the bottom of their toes to avoid making noise when walking and not scaring away rats when hunting. Paws are contracted when walking to prevent them from being blunted, and will extend when hunting mice and climbing.</p>
			<p>Cats, of various species, are the natural enemies of rats. They are kept in various places. There are various colors such as yellow, black, white and gray; body shape like a civet, appearance like a tiger, soft hair and sharp teeth (there are almost hairless varieties). The best with a long tail and short waist, eyes like gold and silver, and a lot of ribs on the palate. The body is small and has an attractive appearance. Curiosity is heavy.</p>
			<p>Cats are agile and good at jumping. It eats fish, mice, rabbits, etc. Cats love to eat fish and mice because they are nocturnal animals and need a lot of taurine in order to see clearly at night, and mice and fish contain taurine in their bodies, so cats do not just eat fish and mice because they like them, but also because they need them. As a natural enemy of rodents, cats can effectively reduce the damage caused by rodents to seedlings and other crops, which can be seen in the ancient Chinese agricultural life by the character.</p>
