			<h2>Living habits</h2>
			<img src="images/view5.jpg"/>
			<p>1. Sleepiness</p>
			<p>Cats spend 14 to 15 hours a day in sleep, and some of them sleep for more than 20 hours, so they are called "lazy cats". The cat's ears will move as soon as there is a sound, and if someone comes near, the cat will wake up at once. Originally cats are hunting animals, in order to be able to feel all the movements of the outside world, sleep is not very dead, only 4 to 5 hours is the real sleep, most of the time should be considered in the "false sleep" or called closed eyes. But cats that have been used to humans since they were young sleep more and sleep longer. </p>
			<p>2. Capriciousness</p>
			<p>The cat is an animal that likes to be alone and appears to be somewhat capricious and self-directed. As a result, it does not see its owner as a monarch and is subservient to orders. Sometimes, you can call it, but it does not hear you. Cats and their owners are not master-slave relationship, they are better seen as equal friends. It is this relationship that is unique and attractive. On the other hand, the cat sees its owner as a parent, and is as pampered as a child, climbing onto its owner's lap when it feels lonely, or jumping anywhere to sit on a spread-out newspaper, showing its pampered attitude. </p>
			<p>3. Cleanliness</p>
			<p>Cats often clean their own fur. Kittens love to lick their bodies and self-clean in many cases. The cat will wipe its beard with its front paws after a meal, and lick its fur with its tongue after being held. This is the cat's instinct to remove the odor from itself to avoid predators. The cat's tongue has many small rough protrusions, which are the most suitable tool for removing dirt. After the owner strokes the cat, the cat licks the area where it was stroked: the cat is remembering the smell of the person because it is worried that it will not find its owner if it is separated from them. Many people mistake this for the cat being too dirty for itself. </p>
			<p>4. Scratching</p>
			<p>Cats have evolved toward being super hunters, with all the organs in their bodies designed to catch up with prey and kill it quickly, and although they have been pets for thousands of years, these constructs have not disappeared. The cat usually learns its skills by chasing and fighting with each other as it grows, and after this stage it will understand what strength will not hurt its partner, but this strength is not suitable for humans, so as the cat grows, it should be curbed when it is scratched and bitten, so it will slowly understand what strength to "attack" you with. </p>
			<p>5. Purring</p>
			<p>The cat's purring not only conveys information but also expresses feelings, thus the owner can read it and communicate with it through observation and judgment. The cat's family will notice that the cat will often purr, and in fact, the purr is different when the cat has a request or not. There is a specific peak in purring when a cat is demanding, similar to the frequency of a human baby's cry. Cats make unusually scary noises at night during estrus, usually like a baby crying, and the volume is so high that it is hard to tell it is coming from such a small animal. </p>
			<p>6. Body language</p>
<p>The so-called "cat body language" means that cats express their mood and desires with ears, tail, hair, mouth and body. If a cat is tired of being under people's feet or beside people, it is a sign of affection if it rubs its head against you. If your cat rubs one of the scents secreted from its mouth onto you, it means it wants to have you as its own. If the cat makes a gurgling sound from its throat, it means that it is in a good mood, and if the cat is like a duck hatching eggs, if its front feet are bent inward, it means that it is at ease and dependent. Cats open their mouths wide in the presence of humans to show trust. </p>
