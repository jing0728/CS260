		<h2>Feeding methods</h2>
			<p>I. Feeding of young cats</p>
			<p>1. Eat little and often, and pay attention to feeding at regular intervals, rations and points. </p>
			<p>2. Timing: feed at a fixed time every day to develop good eating habits. Quantitative: the amount of meals should not be more or less. As the cat gets older, the amount of meals for kittens gradually increases during a certain period of time (usually three or four months) and remains stable until eight months or more. </p>
			<p>3. Generally cats around two months old should eat more than five or six times a day. Kittens are generally fed four times a day until they are three months old, such as at 9am, 12 noon, 6pm and 10pm. When they are three to six months old, they are fed three times a day. After six months of age, feed twice a day. </p>
			<p>4. If the milk given to the kitten is not enough or there is no milk, special pet milk powder can be consumed, and some rice flour can be added to the milk powder when it is older. If milk is consumed directly, it may cause diarrhoea, as kittens cannot digest milk well. </p>
			<p>II. Feeding of adult cats</p>
			<p>1. Cats enter the adult cat stage at 12 months of age and above. The body and digestive system of adult cats are basically developed and can digest and absorb nutrients better. Adult cats need full and balanced nutrition to maintain their optimal health and prevent ageing. </p>
			<p>2. When cats reach the age of 7 years and above, they develop many health problems, especially in metabolism, such as the kidneys and eyes. To address these types of problems, it is important to feed them a low-fat, low-energy diet to help them maintain a normal weight. It is also important to ensure that the food is high in fibre for gastrointestinal health and low in magnesium and phosphorus for urinary and kidney health. In addition, try to provide them with foods that are easy to digest. </p>
			<p>3. Weigh the cat regularly to ensure that it is within the normal weight range and feed it according to the advice of the vet and nutritionist. Assess the cat's body condition regularly and adjust the amount of food fed according to the body condition. Gently scratching your cat's chin is going to increase your cat's goodwill towards you. </p>
