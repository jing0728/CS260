CSS Id and Class
The id and class selectors
If you want to set CSS styles in HTML elements, you need to set the "id" and "class" selectors in the elements.

The id selector
The id selector allows you to specify a specific style for HTML elements marked with a specific id.

HTML elements use the id attribute to set the id selector, and the CSS id selector is defined by "#".

The following style rules apply to the element attribute id="para1":

class selector
The class selector is used to describe the style of a group of elements. The class selector differs from the id selector in that class can be used in multiple elements.

The class selector is represented in HTML by the class attribute, and in CSS, the class selector is displayed with a dot . sign is displayed.

In the following example, all HTML elements that have the center class are centered.
HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is the standard markup language used to create web pages. It provides the structure and content of a web page.

CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is used to style and layout web pages. With CSS, you can control the appearance of a web page, including colors, fonts, and layout.

JavaScript is a programming language that is commonly used to add interactivity to web pages. With JavaScript, you can create dynamic effects like animating elements, creating pop-up windows, and validating forms.

Here are some key concepts for each of these technologies:

HTML:

HTML consists of a series of elements, such as headings, paragraphs, and links, which are represented using tags. HTML tags are surrounded by angle brackets, and the closing tag includes a forward slash. The structure of an HTML document includes a head and a body, and common elements within the head include the title and meta information, while common elements within the body include headings, paragraphs, and lists. CSS:

CSS styles are applied to HTML elements using selectors and declarations. Selectors determine which HTML elements the styles should be applied to, while declarations specify the styles themselves. CSS styles can be defined in separate files, within the head of an HTML document, or directly inline with HTML elements. Common CSS styles include specifying font-related styles, such as font-size and font-family, as well as layout-related styles, such as width, height, and display. JavaScript:

JavaScript code is executed within an HTML document and can manipulate the content and style of a web page. JavaScript can be written directly within an HTML file, or in a separate .js file that is referenced within the HTML. JavaScript is an object-oriented programming language, and it uses objects, methods, and properties to interact with HTML elements and CSS styles. Common tasks performed with JavaScript include validating form input, creating dynamic effects such as animations, and handling events like mouse clicks and page loads. These are just some of the basic concepts for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. There is much more to learn in each of these areas, but these notes should provide a good starting point.
